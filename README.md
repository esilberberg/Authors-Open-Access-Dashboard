# Authors-Open-Access-Dashboard
A Streamlit web app to help researchers understand the open access status of their publications. By entering an ORCID, the app retrieves the user's publications and analyzes them with data from the Unpaywall and JISC Open Policy Finder APIs. For non-OA works , the app presents optional pathways to turn that work OA.
